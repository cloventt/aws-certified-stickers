#AWS Certification Stickers
I got frustrated by the fact that AWS only seems to publish low-res rastirised versions of their
AWS certification badges, so I re-created them in Inkscape.

These are Inkscape SVG images. For them to work properly you need to have the AWS fonts installed
on your system. You can find them [here](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/branding/echo-guidelines/identity-guidelines/typography).
