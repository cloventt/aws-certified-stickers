# AWS Certification Stickers
I got frustrated by the fact that AWS only seems to publish low-res rasterized versions of their
AWS certification badges, so I re-created them in Inkscape.

These are Inkscape SVG images. For them to work properly you need to have the AWS fonts installed
on your system. You can find them [here](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/branding/echo-guidelines/identity-guidelines/typography)

You can use these template files to create printed vinyl stickers of the badges. Or do whatever you want,
I don't own them, all copyright belong to Amazon and our overlord the almighty Bezos.

Under the stickers/ folder there are three files for each badge:

1. The original SVG, which has been baked to paths. This is an inkscape SVG so not optimal for displaying on the web (but it works).
2. A PNG render of the badge.
3. A `*-with-cutline.eps` file. This is an Encapsulated Postcript file with the cutline applied. The cutline colour has been adjusted
to a pure-magenta CMYK line, which is something Inkscape cannot do directly. This special spot colour is used by most cutters to decide
where to cut (duh).
